- description is optional
- status of package defaults to "WAREHOUSE" if no status is specified

2. Updating package status

- A package status can only be in "DELIVERED" once throughout it's existence
- A package status can only be in "PICKED_UP" once throughout it's existence
- Package status can move from one status to the other provided the aforementioned constraints are followed

## Tools Used

- NodeJS (v16 recommended)
- Postgres (v14 recommended)

## App specifications

- TS driven
- Inversify for IOC
